Machine learning model to predict the rating of an anime
Streamist is a streaming company that streams web series and movies for a worldwide audience. Every content on their portal is rated by the viewers, and the portal also provides other information for the content like the number of people who have watched it, the number of people who want to watch it, the number of episodes, duration of an episode, etc.
